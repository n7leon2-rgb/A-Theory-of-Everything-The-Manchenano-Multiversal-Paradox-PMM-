Relevance: Cosmological noise in v3/v4 simulates Fermi-LAT backgrounds, aligning with pre-Big Bang models.

MDR: Neutron Star Mergers and Gravitational Waves
Relevance: $ T_{\mu\nu}^{(\text{ont})} $ in v3/v4 predicts asymmetries in gravitational waves (testable with LIGO O6).

Relevance: Paraconsistent decoherence (v2/v4) resolves the “wavefunction collapse” debate in high-complexity regimes.

Relevance: Holographic metric ($ \dim(S) $) in v3/v4 explains quantum nonlocality (testable via Bell tests with satellite photons).
